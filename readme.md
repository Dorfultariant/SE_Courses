# My Computer Science Courses

This repository contains links to all the Computer Science courses that I have completed.

## Programming

- Python Programming basics: In this course, we got to implement simple terminal based programs to read data and analyze it. This was an introductory course for Programming.

- C -programming basics: This course, like the Python Basics, involved analyzing data and presenting it in terminal based programs. The main focus was memory management and dynamic memory control. Basic data structures like Linked List were applied.

- Object-Oriented-Programming with Java: This course was divided into two parts, in the first part we got to learn the basics of class structures and how they are implemented in Java, simple terminal based programs were created. 

- The second part is Mobile development in which we created Android applications using Android Studio and Java. These applications include different types of listing software using common UI styles such as tablayouts utilizing fragments.

- Introduction to Web programming: Here we had the ability to create a browser based game as the course project. Additionally, we used frameworks such as leaflet with GeoJSON and Frappe charts. The main focus of the course was on content, principles and responsiveness.

- Front-end Development: During this course I got to learn more on website responsiveness and content presentation. The site was implemented using SCSS to write the styling and some javascript to manipulate elements such as dynamic buttons. The website was deployed using github-pages.

- Operating Systems and System Programming: The main goal on this course was to get to know Operating Systems on a deeper level and some utilities were implemented using C in Linux environment.

## Software Development

- Software Development: This courses idea was to introduce to the process of software development, different development processes such as Agile and Scrum. The basics of DevOps were also introduced and common reasons why software development fails. Course project allowed us to create a specification for the application in which we got to create User stories and use-cases based on our written specifications. This design process also included mockups of our application user interface and basic functionality using figma.

- Software Testing Principles: The principles of sufficient testing and implementing testing to Software development were the main idea of the course and we wrote unit tests to different applications to test their functionality. As a course project, we analyzed open-source softwares testing, inspecting possible bugs and running tests on them.

- Computer networks and Internet: This course provided the basic understanding for computer networks and how data flows in the internet between servers, hosts and users.

- Cyber Security Securing Software: In this course, we were able to test different types of attacks on testing software and deepen the knowledge why things like input sanitation and secure design principles should be used from the very beginning of the development process.

- User Interfaces and Usability: This courses objective was to showcase the importance of UI design and usability of the application to provide better user experience. Simple applications were written in dart using Flutter framework.

## Computer Science

- Foundations of Information Processing: This course was an introductory course to basic algorithmic principles, logic and algorithmic complexities in common problems. The intention was to present how important data analytics is and how compression and encryption works.

- Foundations of Computer Science: We were able to take a deep dive to the low level of the working behaviour of computers, deepening the knowledge about logic and introducing microprogrammed computers and how to read microcode. We also studied about machine language and state machines. Essentially this course was a continuation from Foundations of Information Processing.

- Algorithms and Data Structures: The aim of this course was to introduce the limitations of certain algorithms and seed the idea of algorithmic optimization for the task at hand. During the course there were certain limitations how the algorithms needed to be implemented to meet the time complexity specifications. Many data structures such as hashtable, binary tree and heap, linked list and graph were implemented using Python.
