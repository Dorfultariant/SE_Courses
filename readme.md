# My Software Engineering Courses

This repository contains information about the Software Engineering courses I have completed and some of the source codes.


## Programming

- Python Programming basics: In this course, we got to implement simple terminal based programs to read data and analyze it. This was an introductory course to programming.

- C -programming basics: This course, like the python basics, involved analyzing data and presenting it in terminal based programs. The main focus was memory management and dynamic memory control. Basic data structures like Linked List were applied.

- Java OO-Programming basics: This course was divided into two parts, in the first part we got to learn the basics of class structures and how they are implemented in Java, simple terminal based programs were created.

- The second part was Mobile development in which we created Android applications using Android Studio and Java. These applications included different types of listing software using common UI styles such as tablayouts utilizing fragments.

- Introduction to Web programming: Here we had the opportunity to create a browser based game as the course project. Additionally, we used frameworks such as leaflet with GeoJSON and Frappe charts. The main focus of the course was on content, principles and responsiveness.

- Front-end Development: During this course I got to learn more on website responsiveness and content presentation. The site was implemented using SCSS to write the styling and some javascript to manipulate elements such as dynamic buttons. The website was deployed using github-pages.

- Operating Systems and System Programming: The main goal on this course was to get to know Operating Systems on a deeper level and some utilities were implemented using C in Linux environment.


## Software Development

- Software Development: This course introduced the software development process, covering good and bad practices, Agile and Scrum methodologies, and basics of DevOps. The course project involved creating a specification for an application, including user stories, use-cases, and design mockups using Figma.

- Software Testing Principles: This course focused on sufficient testing principles and implementing testing in software development. We wrote unit tests for various applications, applying both white-box and black-box testing. The course project involved analyzing open-source software usability and testing.

- Computer networks and Internet: This course provided the basic understanding of computer networks and how data flows in the internet between servers, hosts and users. Different kinds of networks were also examined.

- Cyber Security Securing Software: In this course, we were able to test different types of attacks on testing software and deepen the knowledge why things like input sanitation and secure design principles should be used from the very beginning of the development process.

- User Interfaces and Usability: The objective of this course was to emphasize the importance of UI design and usability for a better user experience. Simple applications were written in Dart using the Flutter framework. The course project involved designing an application in teams, creating specifications, identifying target user groups, and estimating userbase, along with UI design prototypes using Figma.


## Computer Science

- Foundations of Information Processing: This course was an introductory course to basic algorithmic principles, logic and algorithmic complexities in common problems. The intention was to present how important data analytics is and basic working of compression and encryption.

- Foundations of Computer Science: We got to take a deep dive to the low level of the working behaviour of computers, deepening the knowledge about logic and introducing microprogrammed computers and how to read microcode. We also studied about machine language and state machines.

- Algorithms and Data Structures: The aim of this course was to introduce the limitations of certain algorithms and seed the idea of algorithmic optimization. In addition to solving common algorithmic problems, we implemented data structures such as hashtable, binary and AVL tree, linked list, and graph using Python.
