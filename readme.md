# My Software Engineering Courses

This repository contains information about the Software Engineering courses I have completed and some of the source codes.


## Programming

- Python Programming basics: In this course, we got to implement simple terminal based programs to read data and analyze it. This was an introductory course to programming.

- C -programming basics: This course, like the python basics, involved analyzing data and presenting it in terminal based programs. The main focus was memory management and dynamic memory control. Basic data structures like Linked List were applied.

- Embedded C-programming course for Atmega 328p and Atmega 2560 -microprocessor platforms. In this course, we got to program microprocessors based on requirements and read the datasheet for the microprocessors to select which registries needed to be set and how to get things like Pulse-Width modulation, analog-to-digital conversion working without libraries such as Arduino Wiring. The course project consisted of communication between two Arduino boards, Uno R3 and Mega 2560 R3, and an alarm system that had motion sensing, LCD, keypad and buzzer as sounding alarm. Basically, if movement was detected from the PIR sensor, a timer started counting down and the user had to input the correct password to prevent the alarm. Overall, the course was a great introduction to embedded programming and it gave insight into development in a limited environment.

- Java OO-Programming basics: This course was divided into two parts, in the first part we got to learn the basics of class structures and how they are implemented in Java, simple terminal based programs were created.

- The second part was Mobile development in which we created Android applications using Android Studio and Java. These applications included different types of listing software using common UI styles such as tablayouts utilizing fragments. For the course project, we made a simple turn-based game in which a player was able to choose from a set of different characters and play against a bot. This course provided the basic Android development experience where connecting UI and basic functionality was looked upon.

- Introduction to Web programming: Here we had the opportunity to create a browser based game as the course project. Additionally, we used frameworks such as leaflet with GeoJSON and Frappe charts. The main focus of the course was on content, principles and responsiveness.

- Front-end Development: During this course I got to learn more on website responsiveness and content presentation. The site was implemented using SCSS to write the styling and some javascript to manipulate elements such as dynamic buttons. The static website was deployed to github-pages.

- Advanced Web Applications: Extending from Introduction to Web programming course, this course introduced backend where Express nodejs was used in conjunction with MongoDB to provide a way to store user information and provide more complicated features for a website. For frontend, in this course we got to use PUG view engine as an easier way to write HTML pages and with HTML we used mainly Vanilla Javascript. Another part of the course was to use React to build frontend for weekly tasks and could optionally be used in the project. However, I opted to use rather basic tools like HTML (written with PUG) and Javascript with Materialize library for creating visual layout. Overall, the course was quite good introduction to communication between frontend and backend for websites and it gives basic tools to advance further.


## Software Development

- Software Development: This course introduced the software development process, covering good and bad practices, Agile and Scrum methodologies, and basics of DevOps. The course project involved creating a specification for an application, including user stories, use-cases, and design mockups using Figma.

- Software Testing Principles: This course focused on sufficient testing principles and implementing testing in software development. We wrote unit tests for various applications, applying both white-box and black-box testing. The course project involved analyzing open-source software usability and testing.

- Computer networks and Internet: This course provided the basic understanding of computer networks and how data flows in the internet between servers, hosts and users. Different kinds of networks were also examined.

- Cyber Security Securing Software: In this course, we were able to test different types of attacks on testing software and deepen the knowledge why things like input sanitation and secure design principles should be used from the very beginning of the development process.

- User Interfaces and Usability: The objective of this course was to emphasize the importance of UI design and usability for a better user experience. Simple applications were written in Dart using the Flutter framework. The course project involved designing an application in teams, creating specifications, identifying target user groups, and estimating userbase, along with UI design prototypes using Figma.

- Introduction to DevOps: Course about a development, test, deploy pipeline for Web Application which is run in Microsoft Azure. The idea was to fix existing development process, where features would need to be manually tested and deployed, to work automatically. Essentially, how the pipeline works is that when new feature is merged to main or production branch, the pipeline runs tests and upon successful completion containerizes the application and deploys it to Microsoft Azure where the application is accessible through web browser with the new features. The application is rather simple as the main thought was to introduce how pipelines are configured and how apps can be deployed.

## Computer Science

- Foundations of Information Processing: This course was an introductory course to basic algorithmic principles, logic and algorithmic complexities in common problems. The intention was to present how important data analytics is and basic working of compression and encryption.

- Foundations of Computer Science: We got to take a deep dive to the low level of the working behaviour of computers, deepening the knowledge about logic and introducing microprogrammed computers and how to read microcode. We also studied about machine language and state machines.

- Algorithms and Data Structures: The aim of this course was to introduce the limitations of certain algorithms and seed the idea of algorithmic optimization. In addition to solving common algorithmic problems, we implemented data structures such as hashtable, binary and AVL tree, linked list, and graph using Python. The course provided basic understanding when to use each type of data structure and how to estimate the performance based on the size and type of input data.
